# Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data* course project

Repository for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example [this article](http://www.insideactivitytracking.com/data-science-activity-tracking-and-the-battle-for-the-worlds-top-sports-brand/). Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users.

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate an ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal was to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

This repository contains the following files:

<table>
<tr><th>File Name</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>README.md</td><td>Documentation explaining the project and how to use files contained in the repository.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>Codebook.md</td><td>R A description of the data in a data set, including variable names, descriptions and data formats.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>run_analysis.R</td><td>R script to download the zipped data files, unpack them into a directory, read the unzipped files into a set of data frames, and then clean the data. The cleaned data, consisting of an aggregated data table of means and standard deviations with human readable variable names is then output to a text file for analysis.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>tidyData.txt</td><td>A standard ACSII text file containing the cleaned, aggregated mean/standard deviation data.</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top>tidyData.csv</td><td>An alternative version of <code>tidyData.txt</code> in .csv format.</td></tr>
</table>
